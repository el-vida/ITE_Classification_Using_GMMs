# ITE_Classification_Using_GMMs

These prgrams were developed in the course of a research exchange semester at AIT Lab, which is part of the Department of Computer Science of ETH Zurich (https://ait.ethz.ch/),
in cooperation with RWTH Aachen University, supervised by Dr. Anna Maria Feit (https://annafeit.de/).

The overall subject was the analysis of the world's largest online typing study organized by ETH Zurich, Cambridge University and Aalto University. Detailed information can be found here: https://userinterfaces.aalto.fi/typing37k/


If you are interested in the topic and you want to participate in the online typing study, please refer to the following link: https://typingtest.aalto.fi/

Furthermore, if you happen to be a German speaker, there is also a German typing test available here: https://tipp-test.de/


A detailed description as well as instructions on how to use the programs will be updated shortly.
