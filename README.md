## ITE_Classification_Using_GMMs

These programs were developed in the course of a research exchange semester at AIT Lab, which is part of the Department of Computer Science of ETH Zurich (https://ait.ethz.ch/),
in cooperation with RWTH Aachen University, supervised by Dr. Anna Maria Feit (https://annafeit.de/).

The overall subject was the analysis of the world's largest online typing study organized by ETH Zurich, Cambridge University and Aalto University. Detailed information can be found here: https://userinterfaces.aalto.fi/typing37k/.

The classification of ITEs using GMMs has been done in succession to another students work on the effectiveness of predictions for increased productivity. For more information, please refer to his github repository: https://github.com/itko/typing_automation. Parts of those programs will also be used in this repository for data preprocessing.


If you are interested in the topic and you want to participate in the online typing study, please refer to the following link: https://typingtest.aalto.fi/
Furthermore, if you happen to be a German speaker, there is also a German typing test available here: https://tipp-test.de/


A detailed description as well as instructions on how to use the programs will be updated shortly.
